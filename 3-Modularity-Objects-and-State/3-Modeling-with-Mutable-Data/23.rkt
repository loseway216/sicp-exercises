; TODO:
; A deque (“double-ended queue”) is a sequence in which items can be inserted and deleted at either the front or the rear.
; Operations on deques are the constructor make-deque, the predicate empty-deque?, selectors front-deque and rear-deque, and mutators front-insert-deque!, rear-insert-deque!, front-delete-deque!, rear-delete-deque!.
; Show how to represent deques using pairs, and give implementations of the operations.151 All operations should be accomplished in Θ(1) steps.
